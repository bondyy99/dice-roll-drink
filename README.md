# dice-roll-drink

Convoluted dice drinking game, whenever I suggested it with people before, the rules were too long to explain and people wouldn't lose interest halfway through me explaining.

That's where I came up with the idea for a dice roll app that has the prompts for who has to drink built it. Enjoy!

RULES:

- Two dice, certain 'special' rolls can require you or others to drink
- 7 - person sitting to the left of the roller drinks
- 11 - person sitting to the right of the roller drinks
- 3 - first three rolled (either on one die or totalled across both) makes the roller the 'threeman', who then has to drink with every subsequent three (this can only be passed off by the threeman rolling a three himself)
- 'Two of a kind' - when the same face appears on both dice, that many fingers of drink can be distributed out amongst the group as the roller sees fit; these can all be given to one person or (i.e. two 3s means three fingers can be handed out with 1 finger to three people, 2 to one and 1 to another or all 3 to one person)
- 'Shit roll' - anything that doesn't make anyone else drink (i.e. anything except the above); ends the roller's turn and roller drinks
- 'Buffalo' - everyone must drink with their non-dominant hand, anyone caught not doing so has to finish their drink and get a new one; requires the accusor to call them out by saying buffalo

FIXES:

- Dice images are repeating themselves inside the div on certain resolutions, need to find a fix...

FUTURE UPDATES:

- 'Rolling dice' animation when user prompts a roll
- Formatting for phone screens
- More obvious prompts (i.e. background colour flashing green on 'special' rolls, and red on 'shit' ones)
- Higher quality dice face PNGs
